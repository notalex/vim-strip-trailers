bq. Trailing whitespaces make a lot of noise in a revision control system.
This is a Vim script to highlight trailing whitespaces and then strip them.

Usage:

One can place the following configuration in their .vimrc to remove the trailing whitespaces on file write:

bc. let g:strip_whitespaces_on_save = 1

Or one can manually invoke the script using the following keybinding:

bc. <Leader>sw

h4. Installation

bq. If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend using "Vundle":https://github.com/gmarik/vundle

With Vundle, you can simply add *Bundle 'notalex/vim-strip-trailers'* to your *.vimrc* and run

bc. :BundleInstall
